Preservation of quantum non-bilocal correlations in decoherence induced entanglement-swapping experiments

A tripartite quantum network is said to be bilocal if two independent sources produce a pair of bipartite entangled state. Quantum non-bilocal correlation emerges when the central party which possesses two particles from two different sources perform Bell-state measurement on them and entanglement or rather, nonlocality is generated between the other two uncorrelated systems in entanglement-swapping experiment. But the interaction of such systems with environment modelled by Amplitude Damping Channel(ADC) reduces quantum non-bilocal correlations. Here we show that, such diminishing effect can be slowed down by adapting weak measurement technique in this scenario. In most of the cases, quantum non-bilocal correlations are preserved against decoherence even if both success and failure of the post-selection governing weak measurement are taken into account.
